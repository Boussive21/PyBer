#Overview and Purpose
We have been asked to create a report from the data and the data frame that I used earlier in the module to create a report of rideshares and their fares in different type of locations (rural, urban, and suburban). We would primarily use group by functions with sum and counts as well in order to get the data into a useable form. We would then use the line graphs and pivot tables to consolidate the data into a digestible format for the end user.  
#Results
  
What we learned from the basic table is that. 
-	Rurals have least drivers 
-	Both rural and suburban have less drivers than riders but that is not true for urban 
-	It is more profitable to be a driver in a rural area than an urban measuring driver per fare
-	Total fares urban has more than twice as many than rural. 
#Summary for January and April
 
What we can draw from this chart is that total fares amounts are dominated by Urban environments because the demand is more prevalent in that environment. This also explains why the average per fare for driver is much higher due to distance between drives as well lack of riders available. 
#Recommendation 
-	Discount per mile in suburban and rural to make it more appealing to ride. 
-	Add fare incentives or milestones that make drivers more willing to go out for more rides
